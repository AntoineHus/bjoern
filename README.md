# bjoern-radare: A Radare to Graph Database Exporter

bjoern-radare allows analysis results of the Radare reverse
engineering framework (http://www.radare.org/) to be imported into
graph databases for subsequent analysis via traversals. It thus
exposes results of function, argument, and variable detection, control
flow graphs, including the corresponding instructions and basic
blocks, as well as data, code and call cross references.

You can find its documentation here:
