Welcome to bjoern's documentation!
=================================

Bjoern is a platform for the analysis of binary program code that
ports, extends, and reimplements concepts of the source code analysis
platform joern to enable analysis of native code. It generates a graph
representation of native code directly from output provided by the
open-source reverse engineering toolchain radare2, and stores it in an
OrientDB graph database for subsequent mining with graph database
queries.
