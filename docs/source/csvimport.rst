Plugin: CSV Import
==================

This plugin allows property graphs to be imported into the graph
database. It requires nodes and edges to be specified in a CSV
format.

Usage
-----

The plugin can be invoked via an HTTP GET request or via the utility
'bjoern-csvimport.sh'.

The HTTP GET request can be issued with curl as
follows

.. code-block:: none

	curl http://localhost:2480/importcsv/<nodeFilename>/<edgeFilename><dbname>/

where nodeFilename is a CSV file containing nodes, edgeFilename is a
CSV file containing edges, and dbname is the name of the database to
import into.

Alternatively, the script 'bjoern-csvimport.sh' can be invoked as follows

.. code-block:: none

	./bjoern-csvimport.sh [dbname]

where dbname is the name of the database. The tool will automatically
impor the files 'nodes.csv' and 'edges.csv' if present in the current
working directory.

Configuration
--------------

none.

Input Format for Nodes
----------------------

Nodes are described using a CSV file format, where the first line
describes the row format (CSV header), and the remaining lines contain
the actual nodes. The tabular character is used as a
deliminator. Double-quotes can be used to enclose values of fields
that contain newlines or tabs.

The CSV header has two mandatory fields: `command`, and `key`.

The `command` field specifies the action to perform for this
node. The following commands are currently supported:

"ANR:" Add node, replacing any existing node with the same key.
"A": Add node, creating an alternative key if a node with this key
already exists. The alternative key is generated by adding an
underscore followed by a number to the key.


`key`: a key to identify the node. The strategy to follow when a node
with this key already exists depends on the command.

The remaining fields specify the names of node properties.


Input Format for Edges
